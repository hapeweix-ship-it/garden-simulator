# Garden-Simulator
The Garden-Simulator is a straight forward python program that simulates a garden in a 5x5 grid where you can plant and harvest crops.

The `show` command prints row and column indices.


```text
     0   1   2
  +---+---+---+
 0| . | o |   |
  +---+---+---+
 1|   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+
 2|   |   | R |
  +---+---+---+
```

The symbols in the grid mean:

- empty space: an empty cell
- `o`: a dug hole
- `.`: a planted seed
- `R`: a ripe crop that can be harvested


### Following Commands are at your disposal:
- `show`
- `dig row col`
- `plant row col crop`
- `water row col`
- `day`
- `harvest row col`
- `help`
- `quit`


## Installation

Open PowerShell in the project folder and run:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## Run the Garden-Simulator
In you Terminal in the project root run following command:
```powershell
python main.py
```

## How The Code Is Organized

The rules of the garden simulator live in `garden.py`. This file uses simple functions and core programming concepts. Most of the edits you have to perform in this file.

The command-line interface lives in `main.py`. It reads what commands the player types, splits them into words, and then uses `if/else` logic to decide what should happen.

The garden drawing code lives in `cli_view.py`. The `GardenPrinter` class turns the garden data into an ASCII grid that can be printed in the terminal.

The assignment test runner lives in `test_runner.py`. It checks each task and clearly shows which tests pass and which still need work.


## Data Model

Each cell is a dictionary with:

- `state`: `"empty"`, `"hole"`, `"seed"`, `"ripe"`
- `crop`: `None` or string
- `water`: integer
- `days_as_seed`: integer

## Rules

- `dig` is only allowed on `empty` and changes state to `hole`
- `plant` is only allowed on `hole`, changes state to `seed`, sets `crop`, sets `water=0`, and sets `days_as_seed=0`
- `water` is only allowed on `seed`, and increases water up to `WATER_MAX`
- `day` affects all cells at once:
  - water decreases by 1
  - growth is deterministic:
    - a `seed` with enough water gains one qualifying day
    - after `RIPE_DAYS_FROM_SEED` qualifying days, `seed` becomes `ripe`
- `harvest` is only allowed on `ripe`, returns the crop name, and resets the cell to `empty`
- harvesting a `tomato` also appends a line to `harvests/tomato.txt`


## How to work with generative AI
You should only use a chat based AI product.

Use it like your personal code buddy that helps you with all sorts of programming related questions regarding syntax, logic or programm flow.


## Tutorial 1: How to add new code to the project
Open `main.py` and go to line 97 where you find following code 
```python
print("Garden Simulator")
```

Replace it with:
```python
print("Garden Simulator by <Your Name>") #Example: print("Garden Simulator by Tobias")
```
Save the file using `CTRL+S`

Start the Garden-Simulator in your terminal and enter:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Tutorial 2: Invoke Tests

In a GitHub Codespace, run:

```bash
make test
```

You can also invoke the test runner directly:

```bash
python test_runner.py
```

Each test prints `[PASS]` or `[FAIL]`. All six required tests must pass, including both growth tests for task 5.
